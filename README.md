# FirstRides.

FirstRides. is an app that allows users to share and find rides that to specific destinations. Users can select a destination, once they are on the page they can enter their location to see a map with rides around them. The pins represent pickup locations. Once the rider selects a pin, they will see the ride on the left bar, which they can click on and join or unjoin. Users can also offer a ride a from this page. Up top, a user can also find a list of all their rides existing. This app was developed with an express / node.js back end to hold all the user data. A google maps api / library and a react-bootstrap library for popups were both used, as well.
